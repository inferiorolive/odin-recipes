    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    
    <p>In this recipe you'll learn how to make a creamy mushroom pasta. The dish is typically made with a flat pasta such as liguine or parpadelle, but you can use whatever pasta you have.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>Serves 3</p>
    <ul>
        <li>500g chestnut mushrooms, brushed clean</li>
        <li>350g dried linguine</li>
        <li>250ml full-fat dairy cream</li>
        <li>15g butter</li>
        <li>1/2 large onion</li>
        <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>Basil (torn) to serve</li>
        <li>Finely grated parmigiano reggiano</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a pasta pot with water and begin to heat.</li>
        <li>Chop the garlic and onion into small pieces. Slice the mushrooms into 4-5mm pieces.</li>
        <li>Heat a stainless steel pan over a medium flame. Add oil when hot and throw in the onion.`</li>
        <li>After 3-4 minutes, just as the onion edges begin to turn brown, add the garlic. Fry until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Cook until golden and slightly crispy.</li>
        <li>Lower the steel pan heat down to the lowest setting. Add salt to the boiling pot and, setting a timer for 9 minutes, add the pasta.</li>
        <li>Add a knob of butter to the pan, stir the mushrooms, and add the cream to the pan. Give a generous grind of pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook until reduced to a thick, creamy sauce. Turn the heat off and incorporate half the parmesan.</li>
        <li>Once the timer goes off, use a small mug to scoop some pasta water and drain off the rest.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta and 50ml of pasta water to the cream sauce, stirring. If the mixture is too thick, add splashes of pasta water until it reaches the desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Transfer forks of pasta to warmed plates by twisting a wooden fork and moving over with a metal spoon.</li>
        <li>Finish the dish with the rest of the parmesan and the basil pieces. Give a twist of salt and pepper and enjoy hot!</li>
